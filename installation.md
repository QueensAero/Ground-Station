## Installation Instructions
The installation instructions assume that users have already installed a JDK and Eclipse. The next person who does this from scratch should add instructions here (or put a link to a tutorial).

1. Download the source code as a .zip file or clone the repository.
2. If on a Windows machine, navigate to "\<Install Dir>/Ground-Station/lib/windows" and run the "configure.bat" script. If on a Mac, navigate to '\<Install Dir>/Ground-Station/lib/macos' and run the "configure.command" script.
3. Launch Eclipse.
4. In Eclipse, click on "File > Import..."
5. Select the "Existing Projects into Workspace" option, and click "Next".
